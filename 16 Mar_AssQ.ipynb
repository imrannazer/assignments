    "Bias and Variance are two important sources of error in machine learning models. Bias refers to the error that is introduced by the model's assumptions about the target function and is related to the model's simplicity. Variance refers to the error that is introduced by the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data and is related to the model's complexity. Both high bias and high variance can lead to poor performance and generalization, and it is important to strike a balance between them by selecting an appropriate model complexity and regularization technique."
